## [1.7.1] - 2025-07-17

This is a quality-of-life release focused exclusively on improving documentation. There are no breaking changes or modifications to the library's logic. It is fully backward-compatible with version 1.7.0.

### Changed

-   **Complete Documentation Overhaul**: All public-facing doc comments for `ParsiDate`, `ParsiDateTime`, `ZonedParsiDateTime`, `Season`, and error types have been rewritten to be more comprehensive, clear, and idiomatic according to Rustdoc standards.
-   **Enhanced Examples**: Expanded and clarified code examples for all public functions, covering more use cases, edge cases, and error conditions.
-   **Improved Explanations**: Clarified the internal logic and user-facing behavior for complex topics, including Gregorian conversion, `unsafe` constructors, arithmetic day-clamping, and timezone-aware operations.

### Added

-   **Comprehensive Module-Level Docs**: Added detailed documentation to each file (`lib.rs`, `date.rs`, `datetime.rs`, `zoned.rs`, etc.) to explain the purpose and structure of each module.
-   **Feature Flag Guidance**: Added explicit instructions and examples in the main library documentation (`lib.rs`) on how to enable and use the `serde` and `timezone` crate features.
-   **Standardized Doc Headers**: Added standard copyright and metadata headers to all source files for consistency.

### Fixed

-   **Documentation Consistency**: Ensured a consistent level of detail and formatting across all parts of the public API documentation.
-   **Clarity on Error Types**: Improved the documentation for `DateError` and `ParseErrorKind` to make the cause of potential failures more understandable.

## [1.7.0] - 2025-06-07
This version introduces major new functionality for timezone handling, along with several improvements and fixes to the existing API.

### ✨ Added

-   **Timezone Support (`timezone` feature)([#23](https://github.com/parsicore/ParsiDate/issues/23)):**
    -   Introduced a new primary struct, `ZonedParsiDateTime<Tz: TimeZone>`, for handling timezone-aware date and time objects. This is available under the new `timezone` feature flag.
    -   `ZonedParsiDateTime::now(tz: Tz)`: Creates a new instance representing the current time in the specified timezone.
    -   `ZonedParsiDateTime::new(...)`: A robust constructor that correctly handles Daylight Saving Time (DST) ambiguities and non-existent times.
    -   `with_timezone(&self, new_tz: &NewTz)`: A method to convert a datetime from one timezone to another while preserving the absolute moment in time.
    -   Full implementation of accessors (`.year()`, `.hour()`, etc.), arithmetic operators (`+`, `-` with `chrono::Duration`), and comparison traits (`PartialEq`, `Ord`).
`timezone`).

## [1.6.0] - 2025-04-15 
### Added
  *   **Week of Year:** Calculate the week number within the Persian year (Saturday start).
      *   Added `.week_of_year()-> Result<u32, DateError>` method to `ParsiDate` and `ParsiDateTime` to determine the week of the year for a given date.

## [1.5.0] - 2025-04-12
### Added

*   **Persian Season Support:**
    *   Introduced a new `Season` enum (`Bahar`, `Tabestan`, `Paeez`, `Zemestan`) representing the four Persian seasons.
    *   Added `.season() -> Result<Season, DateError>` methods to `ParsiDate` and `ParsiDateTime` to determine the season a given date falls into.
    *   The `Season` enum provides `name_persian()` and `name_english()` methods to retrieve season names.
    *   The `Season` enum now implements `fmt::Display` using the Persian name (e.g., `println!("{}", Season::Bahar);` prints "بهار").
    *   Added `.start_of_season() -> Result<ParsiDate/Time, DateError>` and `.end_of_season() -> Result<ParsiDate/Time, DateError>` methods to `ParsiDate` and `ParsiDateTime` to get the first and last date/datetime of the season containing the instance.
    *   Added a new format specifier `%K` to `ParsiDate::format()`/`format_strftime()` and `ParsiDateTime::format()` for displaying the full Persian season name (e.g., "تابستان").
    *   Added comprehensive tests for all season-related functionality.

## [1.4.0]

### Added

 **DateTime support with ParsiDateTime**,
Key features introduced:
- **`ParsiDateTime` Struct:** Located in `src/datetime.rs`, stores a `ParsiDate` and H:M:S components.
- **Conversions:** Added `from_gregorian(NaiveDateTime)` and `to_gregorian() -> NaiveDateTime`.
- **Current Time:** Implemented `ParsiDateTime::now()` to get the current system date and time.
- **Formatting:** Extended `format()` method with time specifiers (%H, %M, %S, %T).
- **Parsing:** Implemented `ParsiDateTime::parse()` supporting date and time specifiers.
- **Arithmetic:** Enabled addition/subtraction with `chrono::Duration` and specific `add/sub_days/months/years` methods preserving time. Overloaded operators for `Duration`.
- **Validation:** `is_valid()` checks both date and time components.
- **Error Handling:** Introduced `DateError::InvalidTime` and `ParseErrorKind::InvalidTimeValue`.
- **Serde:** Extended optional `serde` support to `ParsiDateTime`.
- **Internal Visibility:** Adjusted visibility of `ParsiDate` helper methods (`to_gregorian_internal`, `weekday_internal`, etc.) to `pub(crate)` to allow sharing logic with `ParsiDateTime`.
- **Testing:** Added extensive unit tests covering all new `ParsiDateTime` functionality.
- **Documentation:** Updated crate-level documentation, examples, and added doc comments for `ParsiDateTime`.


## [1.3.3]

### Changed
**Change Project Structure:**
The libs.rs file has now been split into the following files for better debugging and faster development:
- src/lib.rs
- src/constants.rs
- src/error.rs
- src/tests.rs
- src/date.rs

> The codes, functions, logical structure, and algorithms of the program have not changed and are the same as the previous version. If you are currently unable to update, there is no need to worry.

  - Support for common separators

  - Added optional serialization/deserialization via `serde` feature flag
  - Compatibility with common formats like JSON, TOML, etc.
